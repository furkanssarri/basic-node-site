# Basic Node.js Site

This project is a simple Node.js application designed to practice basic server-side routing without using any frameworks. It demonstrates how to serve different HTML files based on the requested URL using Node's built-in `http`, `fs`, and `path` modules.

## Features

- Serves static HTML files for different routes (`/`, `/about`, `/contact`)
- Returns a custom 404 page for unknown routes
- Minimal, beginner-friendly code

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
3. Place your `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `404.html` files in the project root.
4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Purpose

This project is for learning and practicing basic server-side routing in Node.js, without any external libraries or frameworks.
